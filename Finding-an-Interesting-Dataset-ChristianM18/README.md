The reason I choose this dataset was becuase as technology is becoming more accessible, ads have progressively gotten worse as in more visible. I briegly am aware of the pyschological tactics used to altered consumers/vieweres opions from previous sociaolgy classes like FOMO(fear of missing out) or artifical happiness, as in without that particular item one will not feel as complete. I also choose this dataset becuase I'm curious to know how other factors impact like income impact consumerism. 

Questions:
1. How does income impact how consumers react to ads?
2. How does age impact consumers reaction to ads?
3. Does sex affect consumers decisions when exposed to ads?
4. Are younger indiviuals more likely to be persuade by ads?
5. Are wealthier indivuals less likely to be persude by ads?
6. Would other social factors influced indivuals decision making when exposed to ads (i.e employment)
7. Are males more likely to be persuaded by ads than females?
8. Is the sample size not sufficient?
9. Indiviuals who make below $50,000 are more likey to be persuade by ads than those who make more than $50,000?
10. Is there no link between the variables?
